# epic_demics
This repository is made for a group project in the context of the Agent-Based Modeling and Social System Simulation course of ETH ZÃ¼rich. 

The theme of this project is Epidemics & Immunizations

It is a project mainly written in MatLab and it will be developped during the following weeks.
